# WordOut

WordOut is a thrilling multiplayer game where 5 to 8 players are assigned words related to a shared topic—except for one, the Imposter, who has a different word. Players must describe their words in 1 minute, convincing others they're in on the same topic. After every round, the group votes to eliminate someone, trying to eleminate the Imposter.

 🧷**Directly cloning from Android Studio (Alternate method):-**

## 🧾Common Rules:
- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific issues.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points🎉 will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, code architecture etc.
- These tasks are for learning and not just scoring points so any kind of Plagiarism or attempt thereof wouldn't be tolerated and would lead to disqualification from OpenCode.
- **Your code should be error-free before creating a pull request.**

> ALL THE FINAL DECISIONS FOR THE JUDGMENT AND AWARDING OF POINTS ⚖️ BASED ON THE SUBMISSION RESIDE WITH THE MENTORS & ORGANISERS. No claim can be made on the number of points awarded by the Mentors & Organisers🙂.
